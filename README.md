# A replacement of CORTANA, without any GUI/Graphic.

## Just Voice control with wake-up word = "AISHA" ( but the speechRecognition spell it as 'Ayesha' )

---
There is a latency of 15 seconds for the speech recognition and waiting for the wake up word. then it gets phrase and acts accordingly
Until now, commands which work good are:
- Play/pause song
- Volume control
- Open Apps (if not present in disk, opens in Browser)

Issue with making it "Play abcxy" song is the differentiation of "play" and "play song". Just need to work more on the specification.
I want to learn on how to apply Machine Learning in this assistant and make it learn the user commands and its respective actions.
